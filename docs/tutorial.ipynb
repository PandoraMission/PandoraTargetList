    "Target definition files are JSON files that contain _static_ information about a given astrophysical target that is useful in creating a schedule of observations for Pandora. This includes information such Right Ascension and Declination at a given epoch, the name, as well as any stellar and planetary parameters, to name a few. This is not to say that some of the information in the target definition files _can't_ change, just that it's a container for information that won't change often, if at all. It does not contain parameters such as observation priority, how many times the target has been observed, when the target will be observed, etc. that are subject to frequent change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target definition files are categorized based on what type of target they are with reference to the Pandora SmallSat observing strategy. It's possible for a target to be in multiple categories, depending on the different roles it plays in the Pandora mission. For instance, the system WASP-69 is in both the `primary-exoplanet` and `occultation-standard` categories since it's both a target on the prime mission target list and one that the mission wants to obtain data for while Pandora is occulted by the Earth, when possible. The information contained within the target definition files in each category can vary, however, since some categories are sensitive to time-critical scheduling events such as transits while others can be observed at any time. Viewing the files in the different categories will give you a feel for the type of information required for each."

    "Finally, we can save the priority file that we've created using the `save` method. This method is commented out below to prevent accidental saves, but should you choose to save your changes, the `save` method will automatically save the prioritization you've made in the correct location within the target definition file directories using the proper header. Similar to when the `Target` class is initialized, the `Priorities` class takes `author` as an argument, with the default set to `author=system`, so be sure to change that upon initialization if you want something different listed for the author field in the prioritization file header!"
